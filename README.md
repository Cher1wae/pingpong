## Overview

This project is a lightweight, interactive “KeyPress Challenge” game built for the browser. The user tries to hit a ball (or respond via keypress) in a pong-style scenario, accumulating a score while maintaining lives and racing against the clock.

On the landing screen you’ll see:

* **Score**: starts at 0
* **Lives**: starts at 3
* **Time**: measuring how long you last
* A **Start Game** button to begin the challenge
  ([cher1wae.github.io][1])

## Features

* Simple UI displaying score, lives and elapsed time
* Restartable game via “Start Game” button
* Detects key presses for action (hit/miss logic)
* Lives system: you lose a life when you miss
* Tracks total elapsed time and possibly high-score logic (depending on implementation)
* Works in modern browsers with minimal dependencies

## Demo

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You’ll need a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) that supports HTML5 and modern JavaScript.
For local development, having a local web server is recommended (for example, using `live-server` or `http-server`).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cher1wae/pingpong.git  
   ```
2. Navigate into the directory:

   ```bash
   cd pingpong  
   ```
3. (Optional) Install dependencies if any (e.g. via npm) — if the project uses build tools:

   ```bash
   npm install  
   ```

### Usage

Run the project in your browser:

* If using a simple HTML/JS project: open `index.html` in a browser.
* If using a local server:

  ```bash
  npx http-server .  
  ```

  Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` (or assigned port).
* Click **Start Game** and use the key presses as instructed.

## How to Play

1. Click **Start Game**.
2. Use the designated key(s) (e.g., spacebar or arrow key) to hit/respond to the moving ball.
3. Each successful keypress increases your **Score**.
4. If you miss, you lose a **Life**. You start with 3 lives.
5. The **Time** counter shows how long you’ve been playing.
6. Game ends when Lives reach 0 (or when some other terminate condition is met).
7. Try to keep your lives alive while maximizing your score and survival time.
